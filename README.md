# Face Detection Project

A simple real-time face detection application built with **Python** and **OpenCV**.

This project uses the `haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml` classifier to detect human faces from a webcam feed and highlight them with bounding boxes.

---

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- Python 3
- OpenCV
- Haar Cascade Classifier

---

## 🚀 How It Works

1. The script captures video from your system’s webcam.
2. It converts each frame to grayscale.
3. It uses the Haar cascade model to detect faces.
4. Detected faces are marked with a rectangle in real-time.
